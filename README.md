# interactive-login-panel-bird
An interactive and engaging login panel designed with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. When the text box is clicked, a bird takes flight, adding a dynamic touch to the form. Upon clicking the password field, the bird closes its eyes. The bird flaps its wings when the cursor hovers over it. The bird's eyes also follow the cursor.
